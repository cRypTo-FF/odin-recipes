This project is all about learning the essential front- end technologies for building a full stack Web application.

The different types of front-end technologies are:

1. HTML - HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is a simple mark-up language. It forms the basis for structuring web page elements. Here all the content goes within a tag. It helps the browser to display the elements in a structured manner. It can be viewed as the bare skeleton of any webpages.
2. CSS - Cascading style sheet simply known as CSS. It is a style sheet that is used to beautify the bare html structure like adding animation, colour, altering font size, width etc.
 
3. JavaScript - It is a Robust programming language that is used to enhance user interactivity with the webpage elements. JavaScript is usually seen as a client-side program i.e. this language code runs on client-side rather than the server-side. But in recent times JavaScript is becoming more popular in the Backend development community, thanks to the Node.js framework. There are several versions of javascript, the most recent being Vanilla JavaScript.
 
4. Git and Github: Main purpose of the git is Version control. This helps in tracking all the previous changes to a file or Code. Git allows parallel branching that helps in creating separate versions of pfile and modify it without affecting the original file when the necessary changes are made the altered file can be merged with original to make necessary changes. This feature is further enhanced with help of GitHub. Github provides a collaborative feature where multiple people can independently work on the same file without worrying about overriding a single file. Many people can work on the same file to project simultaneously. which helps in increasing productivity.
